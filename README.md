Alex's NC game reviews front end project.

This application allows users to read game reviews picked up and stored on my backend server. Features include sorting by category, date, tile and user with the functionality to post comments and upvotes reviews.

Must have node v16.16.0 to run.

Run the command 'node --vesrion' to check your version of Node.
If it is older than the version above please run
`npm npm@latest -g`
